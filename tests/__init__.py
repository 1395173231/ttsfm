    This is a medium-length text that should trigger some splitting behavior.
    It contains multiple sentences and should be processed as separate chunks.
    The system should handle this text efficiently and produce good quality audio.

    This is a comprehensive test of the combined audio generation functionality.
    The text is intentionally long to trigger the splitting and combination logic.
    It contains multiple sentences that should be processed as separate chunks.
    Each chunk will be converted to speech individually and then combined.
    The final result should be a single, seamless audio file.
    This approach allows for processing of very long texts that exceed normal TTS limits.
    The system intelligently splits at sentence boundaries for natural speech flow.
    Additional sentences are included to ensure the text exceeds typical limits.
    The audio combination process should handle all chunks smoothly.
    Quality should be maintained throughout the entire generated audio file.
